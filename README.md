# Sudoku solver

This is a functional sudoku solver. [View Project](https://wiebecommajonas.github.io/sudoku-solver/)

## Usage

To put in values, click a cell and input a number. When the sudoku is filled, click "Solve". Be careful though with unsolvable sudokus. The program does not seem to terminate, or takes very long due to it's exhaustive recursive backtracking.

To clear the sudoku, click "Reset".
